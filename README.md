Features:
---------
Simple calculator with features of adding, subtracting, multiplying, and dividing coded in python. It is able to use these functions on decimals, hexadecimals, and octals. Does this by parsing input string and returning a tuple which consists of two operands and an operator. Parses type based off of input and performs operation then prints.
